    "# The Structure of fMRI Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, it is useful to review of the structure of fMRI data. In this lesson, we are going to be focussing on the *spatial* and *temporal* elements of fMRI datasets. As such, it is important that you have a solid understanding of these features before we go any further.\n",

    "## 4D Images\n",
    "\n",
    "At its most basic, an fMRI dataset is a collecting of 3D volumes measured in rapid succession. The speed at which these volumes are collected is given by the TR of the scanning sequence. A typical BOLD sequence will have a TR of 2-3 seconds. This tells us the *sampling rate* or *temporal resolution* of the data. Together, these 3D volumes form a 4D dataset, consisting of three *spatial* dimensions and a fourth *time* dimension. Each point in the dataset can therefore be indexed both by its spatial position, as well as *when* it was collected during the fMRI sequence. Each of these 3D volumes can therefore be thought of as a snapshot in time. A typical fMRI scan may amass around 200 of these snapshots. For each voxel within a volume there would therefore be 200 values, indicating how the BOLD signal changed over the course of the experiment at that point in the brain. This sequence of values is known as the *fMRI time series*, as shown {numref}`timeseries-fig`. The time series at each voxel therefore represents the *raw data* of interest for the purpose of statistical analysis. In brief, the aim is to find patterns within the time series that map on to the pattern of the experimental manipulation. Any region where such a pattern is found suggests the involvement of that area in the experimental task. We will discuss these tasks further in the Experimental Design & Optimisation unit and will be focussing on the statistical analysis later in this unit. For now, just consider the scale of the data. A typical fMRI volume may have dimensions 60 $\\times$ 60 $\\times$ 40, with 200 values at each voxel. This gives over 28 million data points in a single fMRI series. The challenge of fMRI is to try and make sense of this excess of data. \n",

    "## The Need for Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as helping to understand the structure of our data, examination of raw fMRI images can also provide some insight into why preprocessing is needed. First of all, consider the GIF in {numref}`functional-flicker-fig`. This shows a series of fMRI volumes as an animation. Notice the characteristic flickering that is more noticeable in some voxels compared to others. This flickering represents changes in signal intensity over time. In other words, it represents signal *variance*. The fact that the time series at each voxel changes over time is hardly surpising, however, thsi notion of *change* is central to understanding the information that the signal contains.\n",

    "---\n",
    "Illustration of the variance at each voxel over time.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, we want to try and understand *why* the value of the signal changes. In an ideal world, all signal change would be as a result of the experimental manipulation. Unfortunately, in reality, there are many other reasons why the signal may be changing over time. These could relate to noise from the scanner, motion from the subject or other aspects of physiology not connected to blood flow. Whatever the reasons, we conceptualise the variance of a time series ($\\sigma^{2}_{y}$) as a combination of variance associated with the experiment ($\\sigma^{2}_{\\theta}$) and variance associated with other sources ($\\sigma^{2}_{\\epsilon}$). Formally, we would write \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma^{2}_{y} = \\sigma^{2}_{\\theta} + \\sigma^{2}_{\\epsilon}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to our analysis, not only do we want to cleanly separate these sources, but we also want to *minimise* $\\sigma^{2}_{\\epsilon}$. This is because this quantity represents our degree of *uncertainty* about the experimental effects. In most statistical analyses, it is the *ratio* of these sources that is most important. This is why, in part, we need preprocessing to help minimise known sources of signal variance that are *not* associated with the experimental manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond minimising sources of additional variance, preprocessing also aims to address a fundamental difficulty with multi-subject fMRI studies. Although the gross anatomy of the brain will be the same from subject-to-subject, the size and shape will not. This anatomical variability can be substantial, as shown in {numref}`anat-var-fig`. This causes significant issues with the analysis and localisation of results across groups of scans. As such, it is typical to *spatially normalise* fMRI data so that the images from all subjects are in the same coordinate space. Becuase of this, the second aim of preprocessing is to move all subjects into the same space to meet the assumptions of later statistical analyses.\n",

    "## Preprocessing Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin exploring the standard preprocessing steps, there are a number of preliminary steps that are recommended at the start of any new analysis. Firstly, it is always better to work on *copies* of the data, rather than the original files. Not only does this make it easier to start again if there are problems, but SPM can also make invisible changes to the image headers during processing that we will want to remove before starting again. Working with new copies each time is the easiest way to do this. SPM also creates a lot of new files during preprocessing and so it is useful to create a new folder to keep things organised. As such, the first preliminary step is to make a new folder and then create copies of the images inside that folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next preliminary step is to examine the default registration between the functional and anatomical images. Many of the preprocessing steps we will discuss are forms of image registration and, as discussed earlier on the course, we can help the registration algorithms by doing some rough manual alignment to start with. So, for our example data, we would first set the origins of both the functional and anatomical scans to the anterior commissure and then make any further adjustments to bring them into closer alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these preliminary steps are demonstrated in the video below.\n",
